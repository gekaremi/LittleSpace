# LittleSpace
simple demo 

Based  https://github.com/AdamFraserGitHub/Orbital-Mechanic fork https://github.com/gekaremi/Orbital-Mechanic

I liked that all the code takes only a few dozen lines.

But there were strange things about integrating the equations of motion.

I tried to fix them, added a couple of improvements(leapfrog integration,  smoothing parameter epsilon [SOFTENING]), 
slightly modified the look and added a version for the pages https://gekaremi.github.io/LittleSpace/

Surely I added a bunch of errors.

I donâ€™t know what the point of doing that is.
